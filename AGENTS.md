# Instructions


## For PHP Code

### Adding code descriptions 

When asked to add description, provide a brief description below the section  
and explain the code example in more details below the code.  Text should be  
max 80 chars per line, terminated with two spaces. 

### Examples 

Each example builds on the previous one, progressing from simpler to more  
complex concepts. Do not number section titles for examples such as  
Example 1: Basic types, use only simple title such as Basic types.   

- Use modern PHP 8.4. 
- Avoid references to Hello Word! due to overuse in tutorials. Use Hello there! instead. 
- Add a new line after <?php
- Use newline character instead of PHP_EOL
